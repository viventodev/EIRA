    documentation="Open data refers to the practice of publishing (raw) data in a way that is accessible, reusable, machine readable and licensed permissively. It can be generated by a wide range of parties, including public authorities, the semi-public sector, businesses and the public. In the case of public authorities, such as European Union organisations, making their data available for public reuse supports economic development, openness and transparency.&#xA;&#xA;As a matter of fact, public authorities produce, collect or pay for huge quantities of data, referred to as public data, public sector information (PSI) or government data. Most data like this is publicly available, and is gathered at taxpayersâ€™ expense and for their ultimate benefit. Therefore it should be made freely available for both access and reuse.&#xA;&#xA;Source: EU Open Data guide&#xA;http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/eu-open-data-pbOA0416036/downloads/OA-04-16-036-EN-C/OA0416036ENC_002.pdf?FileName=OA0416036ENC_002.pdf&amp;SKU=OA0416036ENC_PDF&amp;CatalogueNumber=OA-04-16-036-EN-C">
