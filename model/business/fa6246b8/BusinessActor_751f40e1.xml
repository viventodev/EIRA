    documentation="A Citizen is a person who is a member of a particular country and who has rights because of being born there or because of being given rights, or a person who lives in a particular town or city.&#xA;&#xA;Every national of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to national citizenship and shall not replace it. [Treaty of Maastricht on European Union, Title II Provisions on democratic principles, article 8]&#xA;&#xA;The main difference between the two [European citizenship and citizenship of a Member State] is that the rights that citizens enjoy as a result of European citizenship are not matched with duties. Legal basis: Articles 9 to 12 TEU and 18 to 25 TFEU. [European Parliament]&#xA;The additional rights EU citizenship confers are detailed at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/citizen/index_en.htm.
