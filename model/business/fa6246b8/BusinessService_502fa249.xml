    documentation="A European public service comprises any public sector service exposed to a cross-border dimension and supplied by public administrations, either to one another or to businesses and citizens in the Union. A Public Service is a mandatory or discretionary set of acts performed, or able to be performed, by or on behalf of a public organisation. Services may be for the benefit of an individual, a business, or other public authority, or groups of any of these. The capacity to act exists whether it is used or not, and the term 'benefit' may apply in the sense of enabling the fulfilment of an obligation. As defined in the revised version of the European Interoperability Framework, a European public service comprises any service provided by public administrations in Europe, or by other organisations on their behalf, to businesses, citizens or others public administrations. Public service â€“ activities that public authorities identify as being of particular importance to citizens (A2C), businesses (A2B) and public administrations (A2A) and that would not be supplied (or would be supplied under different conditions) if there was no public intervention.&#xA;&#xA;Sources: EIF, ISA2 Core Vocabularies, IMM&#xA;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:2c2f2554-0faf-11e7-8a35-01aa75ed71a1.0017.02/DOC_3&amp;format=PDF&#xA;https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/catalogue/distribution/cpsv-ap-specification-v20-pdf&#xA;https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/imm_guideline_1.pdf &#xA;https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/actions/assessing-progress-being-made-towards-interoperability_en &#xA;">
